# VMBackup
Take the backup of VirtualBox VM automatically.
This script works with Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines.
Sytax:
  autoBackup <VM_name>
  
Steps:
1. This script will first save the currently running virtual machine. 
2. A new copy will be created with same name followed by unique number representing the current date and time.
  e.g. if the original VM name is "VM1", 
      the name of the backup copy would be "VM1_041220171525". The number 041220171525 is 
      generated by executing date +%m%d%y%H%M command.
3. Once the backup is creted, this script will resume the original saved VM.

-thats all
